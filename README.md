## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. How does age influence the languages an individual worked with in 2020?
2. What demographic factors impact an individual's opinion on the importance of a formal education?
3. What demographic factors impact how frequently an individual learns a new language or framework?

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks addresses on question as indicated in the title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that contains general functions used for analysis in multiple of the notebook files.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The findings from my analysis can be found on a medium blog available [here](https://jadefreese98.medium.com/how-demographics-impacted-developers-in-2020-b2f4036a0f0a).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, the code found here is open for use however you would like.
