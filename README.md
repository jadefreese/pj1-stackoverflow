## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. How does age influence the languages and individual worked with in 2020?
2. What factors impact an individual's opinion on the importance of a formal education?
3. What factors impact how frequently an individual learns a new language or framework?

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>

## Results<a name="results"></a>

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
