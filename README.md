## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. How did the age an individual wrote their first line of code influence the languages they worked with in 2020?
2. What individual factors impact and individual's opinion on the importance of a formal education?
3. What factors impact how frequently an individual learns a new language or framework?

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
